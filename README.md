# Named-Entity-Recogniotion-Using-HMM-and-MEMM
This project focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER), which is the task of identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, etc. Two models are implemented for NER: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM).
